Varnish QueryString Module
--------------------------

:Author: Dridi Boukelmoune

:Version: 0.1
:Manual section: 3

SYNOPSIS
========

..sourcecode::

   import fsdirector;

DESCRIPTION
===========

With this module, you can make Varnish serve static files from your file system
without an additional server such as Apache HTTPD. The module actually starts a
server thread that will answer Varnish's HTTP requests with static files.

This is a *play with Linux system calls and Varnish internals* Proof of Concept
VMOD. Do I need to mention this is not suitable for production use ? You are
warned ;)

DEPENDENCIES
============

In order to build *and* run the VMOD, you will need:

* Varnish 4 (just in case ;-)
* libmagic

Do not hesitate to report any missing dependency.

HISTORY
=======

This VMOD was initially an attempt to create a *filesystem* director, in order
to test backends manipulation (more precisely directors) introduced by Varnish
4.

Obviously, it failed, but instead of creating a director, I use a backend
declared in the VCL and create a server thread with the backend's parameters.
By the way, I try to reuse Varnish's code instead of writing my own for several
reasons:

* developer => lazy
* it forces me to read and understand lots of code written by experienced C
  developers

There is a strong probability that the director attempt failed because I didn't
use Varnish's internals properly. You can read the commit log to know the steps
I go through while writing it, I'm still playing with it when I want to try
stuff.

EXAMPLE
=======

This is very easy to use::

   import fsdirector;

   backend static {
      .host = "127.0.0.1";
      .port = "8080";
   }
   
   sub vcl_init {
      new fs = fsdirector.file_system(static);
   }

See *src/tests* for more examples.
